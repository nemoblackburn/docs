Here’s how to create a simple profile page. We’ll use GET profile, GET followers, and GET following to display information about a user and their social connections.

To get their username, we can pass their `id` or `username` to GET profile

```tsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/__ID_OR_USERNAME__?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY')
```

And let’s imagine our UI has a field for users to update their bio and profile picture. We can add these to their profile on the protocol using PUT profile/update

```tsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/update?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    properties: [{
      key: '',
      value: ''
    }],
    crypto: 'Solana',
    namespace: 'Primitives'
  })
})
```

Now, we will get all of this information back when we call GET profile again:

- username
- bio
- profile image
- following count
- followers count

To enable users to click inside the following & followers counts and get information on each user, we can GET following and GET followers.

```tsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/followers/__STARTID__?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY')
```

```tsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/following/__STARTID__?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY')
```

These calls will return data in the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "properties": {
      "id": "2qrWc9p5vatLH3kp4CiVXrdQ4V293d8qzmg4ziez6T4k",
      "username": "magiceden"
    }
  },
  {
    "properties": {
      "id": "DPpSMtNnvwNeYhECNv125pfXqYbB2BKbFXaBnpwUc8Js",
      "username": "idetssx"
    }
  },
  {
    "properties": {
      "id": "H2rVxNEiis9zkhxmjAsHrur3apwABxgKMAtj42P4YDDF",
      "username": "pumptothemoon"
    }
```

From here, we can use the `id` or `username` to hyperlink to each additional user profile, enhancing discoverability inside our app.

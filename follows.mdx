Follows represent a follow relationship between two users. Creating follows is easy. Simply pass in the `id` or the `username` of the user creating the follow (i.e. the follower) into the `startId` field, and `id` or the `username` of the follow recipient (i.e. the followee) into the `endId` field. Use the same id you used when creating the profile.

Hereâ€™s an example command that makes user `marcus` follow user `nehemiah` .

```jsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/follow?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    startId: 'marcus',
    endId: 'nehemiah',
  })
})
```

To check if the follow succeeded, you can GET the followers count of the user who received the follow. In this example, we'll ask for `nehemiah`'s followers count:

```jsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/followers/__STARTID__?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY')
```

and you can also check the following count of the user who performed the follow. In this example, we'll ask for `marcus`'s following count:

```jsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/following/__STARTID__?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY')
```

description: 'How to put follows onchain when a user follows another user'
---

Follows represent a follow relationship between two users. Creating follows is easy. Simply pass in the id of the user creating the follow (i.e. the follower) into the `startId` field, and id of the follow recipient (i.e. the followee) into the `endId` field. Use the same id you used when creating the profile. To lookup a user id, you can use getProfilesFromWallet

Hereâ€™s an example command that makes user `marcus` follow user `nehemiah` .

```jsx
await fetch('https://api.usetapestry.dev/profile/follow?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    shouldWriteOnChain: true,
    startId: 'marcus',
    endId: 'nehemiah',
  })
})
```
